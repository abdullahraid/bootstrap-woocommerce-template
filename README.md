# Bootstrap WooCommerce Template
The WooCommerce templates files redesigned using Twitter Bootstrap v4.

# Usage
Clone the project to your main WP theme and rename the directory to "woocommerce". That's pretty much it!
Make sure the Twitter Bootstrap is enqueued into your pages as this project assumes you already have enqueued it.

Your improvements and pull requests are much appreciated.
